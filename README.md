# AmazonPrimeNowChecker
This is an Amazon Prime now checker for the Nintendo Switch.

When finished it will have two parts - 1) a desktop gui for config with notifications of when one is in stock, and 2) A cli that will print to the console with a message to go to amazon for the switch.

## Trying it out

First you have to install Node JS for your platform (dowload binary installer from https://nodejs.org/en/, or use a package manager like chocolatey or homebrew)

Then install the dependencies from the command line in the folder you checked this out.

```bash
npm install
```

Finally run either the gui or the cli
```bash
npm run gui
```
OR
```bash
npm run cli
```

## Future
Maybe eventually it will be able to check other things.

## Acknowledgements
I got this idea from this [project](https://github.com/kahodes04/AmazonPrimeNowSwitch), and wanted to make it mutliplatform and javascript
